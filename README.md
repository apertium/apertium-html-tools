Apertium Html-tools
====================

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/apertium/apertium-html-tools.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/apertium/apertium-html-tools)

[Apertium Html-tools][1] is a web application providing a fully localised
interface for text/document/website translation, analysis, and generation
powered by [Apertium][2]. Designed with a dead simple build process, minimal
dependencies and only static resources for quick and easy deployment with
any web server, it is relatively lightweight and user-friendly. Html-tools
relies on an Apertium HTTP API such as [Apertium-apy][3] or [ScaleMT][4]
(to a lesser extent).

More information along with instructions for localization is available on the
[Apertium Wiki][5].

Prerequisites
-------------

* Python 3
* curl

Setup
-----

1. Copy `config.conf.example` to `config.conf` and edit it.
1. Then type `make`.

Running
-------

The static files within `/build` (generated by `make`) can be served by any
server. You can use whatever you like, including Apache or even just Python's
HTTP server. For example, to run on locally on `http://localhost:8082` you
can do the following.

    python3 -m http.server 8082

A completely local setup with language data and translation from Apertium,
an APy instance, and Nginx to serve Html-tools is provided via [Docker][6].
After installing Docker, point your `APY_URL` in `config.conf` to
`http://localhost:2737`, run the following, and check `http://localhost:8082`.
Any changes to the local version of Html-tools will trigger a `make`.

    docker-compose up

For production usage, remember to

1. Build with `jsmin`, `csscompressor` and `htmlmin` using
   `pip install -r requirements-prod.txt`.
1. Enable gzip compression on your server.

Contributing
------------

Run `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` to get development dependencies.

[CircleCI][7] runs tests and generates build artifacts including
a live copy of Html-tools using `config.conf.example`.
