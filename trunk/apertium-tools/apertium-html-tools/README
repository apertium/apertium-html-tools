== Running locally ==

The files can be served by any server.  You can use whatever you like, including apache or even just python's http server.  For example, to run on locally on http://localhost:8080 you can do the following:
	$ python3 -m http.server 8080

Type "make" to minify js, html and CSS.

JS and HTML minification requires Java.

CSS minification requires YUI Compressor
