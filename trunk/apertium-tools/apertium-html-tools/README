== Running locally ==

The files can be served by any server. You can use whatever you like,
including apache or even just python's http server. For example, to
run on locally on http://localhost:8080 you can do the following:

	$ python3 -m http.server 8080

== Minification ==

To minify js, html and CSS, type

    make min

JS and HTML minification requires Java.

CSS minification requires YUI Compressor
(http://yui.github.io/yuicompressor/), available for Debian with:

    sudo apt-get install yui-compressor

(If you already did `make nojava`, do make clean first.)

== Concatenation ==

If you don't have / want java, you just type

    make

to get non-minified, simply concatenated files.
