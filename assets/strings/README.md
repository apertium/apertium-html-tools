Localization
============

This directory contains the JSON files powering Html-tools' localization as well as some helpful utilities. `locales.json` contains a reference to each JSON strings file as well as each language's endonym. Localization instructions are available on the [Apertium Wiki](http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Apertium-html-tools).

After editing localizations, do the following or tell another developer:

```bash
$ ./cleanup.sh
$ ./progresstable.sh md # copy this into README.md
```
