Localization
============

This directory contains the JSON files powering Html-tools' localization as well as some helpful utilities. `locales.json` contains a reference to each JSON strings file as well as each language's endonym. Localization instructions are available on the [Apertium Wiki](http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Apertium-html-tools).
